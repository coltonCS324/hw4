Part 2 (24 points):

Download and extract the following file:

a. Download strings.tar.gz and un-tar/gzip it to a directory:

strings.tar.gz  Download

$ tar -zxvf strings.tar.gz

(Note: LearningSuite does something weird to my tar.gz files, so you might need to do this:

$ gunzip strings.tar.gz; tar -xvf strings.tar
)

b. Run "make" to compile the program. (Because there are bugs in the program, several warnings will pop up.)

This program allows you to test the 6 functions by running ./strings <num>, where num is a number 1-6 that corresponds to the function you want to test. Once you are able to successfully compile and run the program, open strings.c and look at the 6 functions.

For each of the 6 provided functions (isHelloWorld, fillHelloWorld, copyString, copyArray, getSubstring, getFirstWord):

Carefully read the function description and provided implementation.
Run ./strings <num> with the function number to see the function's current and expected output.
Explain why the provided implementation does not work. (Put your explanations into a file called hw4-part2.txt.)
Explain what needs to be changed about the implementation to make the function work correctly.
Fix the provided implementation so that the function works as described. Verify your solution by running ./strings <num> with the function number.
You are not allowed to change any other part of the program except for one line in main() that is labeled in Test 4 of strings.c.

To turn in:

Please submit the following:

The answers to part 1 in a file called hw4-part1.txt.
The hw4-part2.txt file containing your explanations for why each of the six functions in part 2 did not work as provided and what you did to fix the issue.
strings.c (from part 2) with your corrected implementations for each of the six functions.
Use the following command to tar/gzip your files:

tar -zcvf hw4.tar.gz hw4-part1.txt hw4-part2.txt strings.c

Submit hw4.tar.gz to LearningSuite.


1.) isHelloWorld
This doesn't work because it needs to be a use strmp..right now it is comparing memory addresses.
2.) fillHelloWorld
This doesn't work because you are given a pointer to an array, and you are trying to modify the actual array. Therefore, you need to modify what the pointer is pointing at using strcpy.
3.) copyString
4.) copyArray
5.) getSubstring
6.) getFirstWord
